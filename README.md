# FolderContentsExtension

This is a test project mostly written using ChatGPT

The idea is to have an explorer extension that will add a right click menu showing the contents of a folder for quick access.

Similar to right clicking steam in the system tray and seeing the 5 most recent games.

This is useful for me with folders of shortcuts on my desktop, I can right click and select the shortcut I want in the folder without having to open the folder and close it again.

working to expand the functionality to include the icons of the files as well as configuration options for setting the types of files to include in the list.

as well as options for setting the number of files displayed.
